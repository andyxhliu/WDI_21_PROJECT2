Then visit Monument Valley for a Jeep tour led by a Navajo guide.

Discover the stark beauty and incredible geology of the American Southwest during this 3-day, 2-night excursion to some of the region’s most beautiful natural sights and parks. Anyone looking to spend some time away from the neon lights of Las Vegas will enjoy this trip in the great outdoors, including an optional chance to camp under the stars. Depart from Las Vegas on day one, heading to Zion National Park by minibus. Spend your time in Zion at your leisure, enjoying a range of hikes suitable for all fitness levels, such as the Emerald Pools Trail or Great White Throne. In the afternoon, continue on to Bryce Canyon, a park famous for its “hoodoo” rock formations, and enjoy a barbecue dinner before spending the night at the campground or lodging option of your choice. Start day two with an optional chance to explore Antelope Canyon (at your own expense) before continuing to Monument Valley. A member of the Navajo tribe that populates the area will take you on a Jeep tour to explore this iconic area. Finish the day at your campsite or lodging. On day three you’ll head to the world-famous Grand Canyon, choosing to enjoy a hike, take a break at the rim-side café or upgrade for an incredible helicopter ride above the canyon’s South Rim.

Check out the sublime rock formations of Zion and Bryce Canyon National Parks before heading to the Grand Canyon, where you can soar above the the South Rim during an optional helicopter flight. Then visit Monument Valley for a Jeep tour led by a Navajo guide. This outdoor adventure includes transport by air-conditioned minibus, choice of camping or lodging accommodations, camping equipment, park entrance fees and Jeep tour. Discover the stark beauty and incredible geology of the American Southwest during this 3-day, 2-night excursion to some of the region’s most beautiful natural sights and parks. Anyone looking to spend some time away from the neon lights of Las Vegas will enjoy this trip in the great outdoors, including an optional chance to camp under the stars. Depart from Las Vegas on day one, heading to Zion National Park by minibus. Spend your time in Zion at your leisure, enjoying a range of hikes suitable for all fitness levels, such as the Emerald Pools Trail or Great White Throne. In the afternoon, continue on to Bryce Canyon, a park famous for its “hoodoo” rock formations, and enjoy a barbecue dinner before spending the night at the campground or lodging option of your choice. Start day two with an optional chance to explore Antelope Canyon (at your own expense) before continuing to Monument Valley. A member of the Navajo tribe that populates the area will take you on a Jeep tour to explore this iconic area. Finish the day at your campsite or lodging. On day three you’ll head to the world-famous Grand Canyon, choosing to enjoy a hike, take a break at the rim-side café or upgrade for an incredible helicopter ride above the canyon’s South Rim.

Check out the sublime rock formations of Zion and Bryce Canyon National Parks before heading to the Grand Canyon, where you can soar above the the South Rim during an optional helicopter flight. Then visit Monument Valley for a Jeep tour led by a Navajo guide. This outdoor adventure includes transport by air-conditioned minibus, choice of camping or lodging accommodations, camping equipment, park entrance fees and Jeep tour. Discover the stark beauty and incredible geology of the American Southwest during this 3-day, 2-night excursion to some of the region’s most beautiful natural sights and parks. Anyone looking to spend some time away from the neon lights of Las Vegas will enjoy this trip in the great outdoors, including an optional chance to camp under the stars. Depart from Las Vegas on day one, heading to Zion National Park by minibus. Spend your time in Zion at your leisure, enjoying a range of hikes suitable for all fitness levels, such as the Emerald Pools Trail or Great White Throne. In the afternoon, continue on to Bryce Canyon, a park famous for its “hoodoo” rock formations, and enjoy a barbecue dinner before spending the night at the campground or lodging option of your choice. Start day two with an optional chance to explore Antelope Canyon (at your own expense) before continuing to Monument Valley. A member of the Navajo tribe that populates the area will take you on a Jeep tour to explore this iconic area. Finish the day at your campsite or lodging. On day three you’ll head to the world-famous Grand Canyon, choosing to enjoy a hike, take a break at the rim-side café or upgrade for an incredible helicopter ride above the canyon’s South Rim. Head back to Las Vegas in the evening.  A full rundown of each day’s itinerary is outlined below. Itinerary Day 1: Las Vegas – Zion National Park & Bryce Canyon (L) After departing Las Vegas, travel by air-conditioned minibus to Zion National Park, a dazzling mix of white, pink and red Navajo sandstone cliffs that make for a photographer’s paradise. Experience the beauty of Zion Canyon however you’d like during free time in the park. Go on a walk or hike, available for every fitness level. Stroll along the Emerald Pools trail, discover the Temple of Sinawava, the Great White Throne or Weeping Rock, or visit the interpretive Human History Museum where you can enjoy an entertaining ranger’s talk on the patio. After a full afternoon in Zion you'll head to Bryce Canyon, a natural amphitheater created by erosion along the eastern side of the Paunsaugunt Plateau. Bryce Canyon is famous for its hoodoos, or dramatic red spires. Take a walk down into the hoodoos for an unforgettable experience.

Check out the sublime rock formations of Zion and Bryce Canyon National Parks before heading to the Grand Canyon, where you can soar above the the South Rim during an optional helicopter flight. Then visit Monument Valley for a Jeep tour led by a Navajo guide. This outdoor adventure includes transport by air-conditioned minibus, choice of camping or lodging accommodations, camping equipment, park entrance fees and Jeep tour. Discover the stark beauty and incredible geology of the American Southwest during this 3-day, 2-night excursion to some of the region’s most beautiful natural sights and parks. Anyone looking to spend some time away from the neon lights of Las Vegas will enjoy this trip in the great outdoors, including an optional chance to camp under the stars. Depart from Las Vegas on day one, heading to Zion National Park by minibus. Spend your time in Zion at your leisure, enjoying a range of hikes suitable for all fitness levels, such as the Emerald Pools Trail or Great White Throne. In the afternoon, continue on to Bryce Canyon, a park famous for its “hoodoo” rock formations, and enjoy a barbecue dinner before spending the night at the campground or lodging option of your choice. Start day two with an optional chance to explore Antelope Canyon (at your own expense) before continuing to Monument Valley. A member of the Navajo tribe that populates the area will take you on a Jeep tour to explore this iconic area. Finish the day at your campsite or lodging.
