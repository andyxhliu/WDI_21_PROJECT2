Then visit Monument Valley for a Jeep tour led by a Navajo guide.

Discover the stark beauty and incredible geology of the American Southwest during this 3-day, 2-night excursion to some of the region’s most beautiful natural sights and parks. Anyone looking to spend some time away from the neon lights of Las Vegas will enjoy this trip in the great outdoors, including an optional chance to camp under the stars. Depart from Las Vegas on day one, heading to Zion National Park by minibus. Spend your time in Zion at your leisure, enjoying a range of hikes suitable for all fitness levels, such as the Emerald Pools Trail or Great White Throne. In the afternoon, continue on to Bryce Canyon, a park famous for its “hoodoo” rock formations, and enjoy a barbecue dinner before spending the night at the campground or lodging option of your choice. Start day two with an optional chance to explore Antelope Canyon (at your own expense) before continuing to Monument Valley. A member of the Navajo tribe that populates the area will take you on a Jeep tour to explore this iconic area. Finish the day at your campsite or lodging. On day three you’ll head to the world-famous Grand Canyon, choosing to enjoy a hike, take a break at the rim-side café or upgrade for an incredible helicopter ride above the canyon’s South Rim.
